# Book Recommender System

## Project Overview
The Book Recommender System utilizes a Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model to deliver personalized book recommendations to users. This project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze user behavior and preferences based on historical data, including ratings and user-item interactions. The goal is to enhance user engagement by accurately predicting and suggesting books that users are likely to enjoy.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Utilizes user data to generate tailored book suggestions.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Employs a sophisticated NCF model that combines aspects of collaborative filtering and neural networks.
- **Scalability:** Designed to efficiently handle large datasets of user interactions and book metadata.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pandas scikit-learn
